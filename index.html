                            For 31 years, Ukraine has been celebrating Independence Day. On February 24, 2022, things have changed. Villages, settlements, cities teeming with life, residential buildings, theaters, administrations, towers, kindergartens and even maternity hospitals are being decimated. Bombs are going off.

                            Ukrainians have bravely taken a stand to protect their homes, families, and country’s future. Soldiers, military, parents, grandparents, gypsies, remote workers, hackers, artists, volunteers, charity organizations. The entire world fights and prays for Ukraine.We have lost our sense of normalcy. Innocent people are hiding in basements. Children are dying. And all of these have happened in one fucking moment with us. No time to predict. No time to be protected.

But when the shelling began, we started running to our acquaintances' dacha in the village of Pylyava, Vyshgodsky district, and the next day we found ourselves on Russian-controlled territory. We had food for a few days and lost communication and electricity; we tried to get in touch by climbing an electric tower to call someone. For 2 weeks, we asked for help to get out and contacted the Territorial Defense and Armed Forces of Ukraine through our acquaintances. And 8.03.2022, we were swimming 35-40 km on the river with a small child (1.5 years) to the territory of Ukraine, holding a white flag. Then we were met by AFU and handed over to volunteers who drove us to Tarascha town to a relative of a pensioner. This is how we lost everything. As it became known a little later, our houses in the village of Sofievskaya Borschagivka had been shelled. At this point, we are homeless, jobless, and moneyless. Funds are needed for living (food, diapers, utilities, etc.). Thank you in advance!</p>

                        <p class="text1">Sirius. Fedorovka village, Vyshgorod district of Kyiv region. Our beloved shelter was under Russian occupation for 35 days. There wasn't even a possibility to deliver food and medicine to the animals. We remained with no light, water, internet, or communication in Dymerskaya United Territorial Community, where the shelter is located. As a result, not guilty animals became prisoners of war. Also, there were 20 employees and the shelter keeper - Alexandra Mezinova. Despite shelling during 35 days of the occupation, the heroes of Sirius went to the nearest villages to buy some food. The animals ate cereals, potatoes, and subproducts. They lost weight but stayed alive, each of 3165 dogs and 218 cats. Now we still need money to buy food and medicine for them.</p>

                            <p>Since I cannot pick up a machine gun and rush into battle (as much as I would like to), I have to help my country in any way I can. Some volunteer, some hack into Russian government websites, some host refugees in their homes. I am a refugee as well, and when I left home, I took the most important things — my professional skills (copywriting), desire to be valid, and faith in a speedy victory. And this is all you need to participate in such a beautiful project. Glory to Ukraine 💙💛</p>

                            <p>My name is Oriana. This name means the first name of ancient Ukraine in the 5th millennium B.C. II can't stay away from this project. I realize my true self, my essence. After seeing my brothers and sisters, my country, my land perish, the first art performance was born in me, and then the whole team, as if God gave. I don't believe in coincidences. It's as if everything's meant to be, and we show the talents of other artists in the NFT. After all, today, we live in a crypto universe by its rules. And this is an opportunity to help people, thanks to the two different beautiful arts, the digital and the real.</p>

                            <p>I started to work on the project as a performance artist. I had a lot of pain and hope inside, but I found a way how I could let all these feelings go. So I started with this point, and now I can’t leave the project until I raise it. Something inside told me that it’s the best way I can help my country now. So I continue to do what I need and deserve.</p>

                            <p>I am a motion designer from Kyiv, Ukraine. On the morning of the 24th of February, I lost my usual comfortable world, like many Ukrainians. We had been building it step by step for a long time. We, as creators, weaved this whole fabric, creating our own unique young country, but with a deep and distant history. But now, one old maniac hiding in a bunker decided to destroy it with millions of fates. So I feel a duty to use my talent and skills to make the light of freedom of our Ukrainian flag live in the works of art. Also, I want to inspire, support, and neutralize the evil that has no brakes now.</p>
